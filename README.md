This is Backend for Calculator Notes Project <br />
Backend is in Python and uses <b> Gemini 1.5 Flash API </b> to process the input <br />
The input is taken from frontend canvas and converted to an image and sent to Gemini for Processing, which in turn returns reponse <br />
Thus any question related to mathematics and physics can be solved by drawing it on canvas <br />
e.g. Getting escape velocity of rocket when the mass and gravity is known can be found easily by drawing an rocket with mass on it an and showing gravitational pull on side as g, to get velocity: just do v = ? on side and the model will return v in response.
